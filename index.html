Crowdsourcing platforms are a powerful and convenient means for
recruiting participants in online studies and collecting data from the
crowd. As information work is being more and more automated by
Machine Learning algorithms, creativity – that is, a human’s ability
for divergent and convergent thinking – will play an increasingly
important role on online crowdsourcing platforms.
However, we lack insights into what crowd workers think about
creative work. In studies in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI),
the ability and willingness of the crowd to participate in creative
work seems to be largely unquestioned. Insights into the workers'
perspective are rare, but important, as they may inform the design
of studies with higher validity. Given that creativity will play an
increasingly important role in crowdsourcing, it is imperative to
develop an understanding of how workers perceive creative work.
In this paper, we summarize our recent worker-centered study
of creative work on two general-purpose crowdsourcing platforms
(Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific). Our study illuminates what
creative work is like for crowd workers on these two crowdsourcing
platforms. The work identifies several archetypal types of workers
with different attitudes towards creative work, and discusses common
pitfalls with creative work on crowdsourcing platforms.

    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4">

Workers on crowdsourcing platforms have become one of the
most thoroughly studied sets of human subjects, and scientists have
at their disposal a strong understanding of the demographics of workers on the crowdsourcing platforms. The academic
literature primarily investigates crowdsourcing from the perspective
of the requester of work, with a focus on optimizing costs, response
times, and work flows. However, in studies in HCI, the ability and
willingness of the crowd to contribute their creativity and participate
in creative studies seems to be largely unquestioned. Our understanding of how workers perceive creative work is limited. Insights into
the workers’ perspective are rare, but important, as they may inform
the design of studies with higher validity. Given that creativity will
play an increasingly important role in crowdsourcing due to human's
ability to excel in areas that machines fall short, such as divergent
thinking, recombination, and analogical transfer, it is imperative to
develop an understanding of how crowd workers perceive creative
work.

    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4">We launched a survey study on two crowdsourcing platforms: Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific. The two platforms are different in regard to worker demographics and what type of work is requested. We selected the two platforms to provide us a complementary insight into creative work on two of the most commonly used crowdsourcing platforms.
      The questionnaire included quantitative Likert-scale items as well
as open-ended items asking the workers to elaborate on their answers. The questionnaire was completed by 323 workers of which
215 (102 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers and 113 Prolific workers) met our qualification criteria (approval rate of greater than 98%,
1000 completed tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and prior encounters with creative work on the respective platform). Workers
were paid USD 1 on Amazon Mechanical Turk and GBP 1 on Prolific. Later, we noticed our estimated task completion times being too
low and compensated workers with bonuses to pay at least minimum
wage (USD 7.50) to all workers.
Three researchers open-coded all open-ended responses, allowing us to form a view of creative work on the platform and a
sense for different archetypal worker profiles.</p>

      <p class="lead pt-4 mb-4">
        <span class="pt-4 bold">Professional workers</span> largely prefer to avoid creative work, as – in their view – this type of work is precarious and connected with considerable uncertainty in the amount of time required to complete
the task and the reward may not be worth the effort in the view
of this worker. Workers reported of unfair rejections for subjective
tasks. Collaborative work flows, as in many experiments focusing
on group creativity, may cause delays in completing the work. The
professional worker will try to avoid such tasks, as they cause idle
time and forfeiting potential earnings from other tasks. Prior work
found that professional workers complete the majority share of work
on crowdsourcing platforms. Professional workers may
thus have been exposed to a variety of different creative tasks on
the crowdsourcing platforms, including standard psychometric tests,
such as the Alternate Uses test. Foreknowledge and pre-exposure
to such tasks may affect the validity of experiments and studies, as
shown in the context of behavioral research.
</p>
      <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
<span class="bold">Pragmatic workers</span> may not care much about what type of tasks
are given to them. In the view of this worker, requesters are going to
request what they want, and some workers will be found who agree
to work on the tasks. For this worker, it is important to have enough
information about the task so that the worker can make an informed
decision whether to accept the task or not.
</p>
      <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
<span class="bold">Novelty seekers</span> are inspired and attracted by novel tasks. The
worker enjoys the unexpected and thus prefers working on creative
tasks that the worker has never seen before. This may lead to a
“tragedy of the commons” effect, where the worker quickly gets to
know the different tasks and then becomes bored with the platform.
Self-Developers are less motivated by monetary rewards, but by
opportunities for learning something new or about themselves. Creative tasks, in this regard, are attractive to this worker, as they allow
the worker to learn something about the worker’s own personality.
For this type of worker, it is important to get post-task feedback in
form of a debriefing with task results.
</p>
      <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
<span class="bold">Casual workers</span> are perhaps most open to creative tasks, as there
is a chance that this type of worker has never completed such tasks
before. On the other hand, as casual workers work only few hours
per week (or even per month) on the platform, the workers may never
come in contact with creative work and may think that there is no creative work on the crowdsourcing platform at all. This type of worker
is also open to collaborative online experiments and workflows, as
potentially precarious monetary rewards and task completion times
do not play a strong role in the workers decision to start a task.

    <h2 class="display-5">Workers' preference for working alone</h2>
    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4">
Supporting creative work has been regarded as one of HCI’s grand
challenges. One trend in current research of the field is supporting the creativity of groups.
In our sample, we found clear evidence of workers shunning on
collaborative work. Almost 90% of the participants preferred solo
work and only 23 participants (10.7%) preferred collaborative work.
We isolated several reasons for this preference. Enforced cooperation
may cause issues both in time and rewards. Cooperation issues were
often brought up, with productivity and efficiency being the second
most popular reason for workers to prefer solo work.
Yet, there is a small, but clear, group of workers who enjoy collaborative creative work. For instance, one Prolific worker noted: “The
tasks that include others tend to be more exciting due to the anticipation of seeing how they will respond to each task.” Other workers
informally noted that they simply enjoy working together with other
people – a trait that, according to our study’s findings, is shared by
only a minority of workers on the two crowdsourcing platforms

Our study found evidence of worker nonnaïveté in regard to common creativity tests, as a subset of creative work requested on crowdsourcing
platforms. The past encounters raise a point to consider: Is the data
collected from these participants on creativity tests valid? Creativity
tests measure a subject’s creativity, but may also be used to measure
other constructs.
<!--
Lu et al., for instance, used the Alternate Uses test
to measure unethical behavior.
-->
Creativity tests – and especially
those relying on an “a-ha” experience, such as Practical Insight Problems – may be affected by prior exposure. If a relatively large portion
of a study’s sample has prior exposure to the very same creativity
test, this should be considered in the study design and participant
screening.

    <h2 class="display-5">Learning from Creative Work</h2>
    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4">
A subset of the workers mentioned learning as a motivator for completing creative work. The proportion of participants reporting on
some aspect of learning taking place during creative work on the
crowdsourcing platform was high. Of the 143 workers who elabo-
rated on this question, only six (4.2%) reported not learning anything
at all. About 30% of the participants (N = 43) mentioned that participation in creativity studies has led to discovering insights about their
own personality. One fifth of the workers reported either developing
their creative skills or awakening to the fact that they already are
creative. Others mentioned having learned subject-specific skills
from completing creative tasks. Increasing one’s productivity and
concentrating for long periods of time were mentioned. Working on
the platforms seems to encourage workers to engage and test their
creativity in other areas, as exemplified by a worker who learned how
to write scripts to support his work on the crowdsourcing platform.
